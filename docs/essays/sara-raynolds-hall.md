## Overview 

Sara Raynolds Hall is a single-story Mayan Pueblo Revival building located at the southern edge of the main campus of the University of New Mexico. It sits on Terrace Street, north of Central Avenue, with its front facade facing west. It is a U-shaped brick and stucco building with 12-over-1 double hung wood windows and exaggerated, geometric buttresses on the corners of the building. Built to house the Home Economics Department (which had been working out of the basement of Hodgin Hall until then), it is today in need of some preservation and repair. For example, nearly half of the original windows are missing and have been covered with stucco. Despite this unfortunate neglect, it is incredibly charming, a quintessential representation of early Pueblo Revival institutional buildings. The hall is surrounded by Parson’s Grove, a Romantic landscape from 1928 named after early UNM Financial Secretary Josephine Parsons, who served from 1894-1927. The landscape includes several dozen evergreens including the largest cedar on campus. The building and site reflect turn-of-the-century themes such as Romanticism, the expanding roles of women in society, and a growing interest in the science of food. 

## Early History

Built in 1920, at a cost of $15, 720, Sara Raynolds Hall was designed by Albuquerque’s first architect, Edward Buxton Christy (1860-1934) and professor Arno Leupold. It is one of a handful of buildings on campus to be on the National Register of Historical Places. Dedicated on Mother’s Day of 1920, the building was named after the mother of one of its biggest financial contributors, Joshua Raynolds, a local businessman. Although I could find no records of what early classes were taught here, typical Home Economics courses during this period emphasized a scientific and economic approach to childrearing, homemaking, and domestic skills. It is easy to envision Home Economics as just another institutional effort to reinforce traditional sex roles, but the history of this field is more complex and has direct ties to the increased literacy and employability of women and the suffrage movement.

## The Depression Years

Correspondence between UNM and the Works Progress Administration reveals the history of a restoration of the building beginning in 1939. It appears that federal government granted UNM $39, 786 for additions to and improvements upon the Home Economics building. The funds were allocated as a non-federal project of the WPA for renovations including plastering, electrical and ventilation work, plumbing and heating improvements, and millwork. Although these efforts did not change the overall plan or aesthetic of the building, evidence of WPA involvement at Sara Raynolds Hall is one more significant connection it has to classic Americana.
