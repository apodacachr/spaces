Sara Raynolds Hall is a single-story Mayan Pueblo Revival building located at the southern edge of the main campus of the University of New Mexico. It sits on Terrace Street, north of Central Avenue, with its front facade facing west. It is a U-shaped brick and stucco building with 12-over-1 double hung wood windows and exaggerated, geometric buttresses on the corners of the building. Built to house the Home Economics Department (which had been working out of the basement of Hodgin Hall until then) is today in need of some preservation and repair. For example, nearly half of the original windows are missing and have been covered with stucco. Despite this unfortunate neglect, it is incredibly charming, a quintessential representation of early Pueblo Revival institutional buildings. The hall is surrounded by Parsonâ€™s Grove, a Romantic landscape from 1928 named after early UNM Financial Secretary Josephine Parsons, who served from 1894-1927.  The landscape includes several dozen evergreens including the largest cedar on campus. The building and site reflect turn of the century themes such as Romanticism, the expanding roles of women in society, and a shifting interest in the science of food.
