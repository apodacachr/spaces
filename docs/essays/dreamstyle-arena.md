# Dreamstyle Arena (AKA The Pit)
## The Concept
Tom L. Popejoy, UNM president 1948-1968, is responsible for many new buildings on the UNM campus and The Pit was one of UNM's most transformative projects that President Popejoy envisioned.  President Popejoy along with Coach Bob King and Architect Joe Boehning created a visual plan and stadium style that would be recognized by architects and sports enthusiasts across the country.  The prior home of Lobo Basketball was the Johnson Gymanasium which held 7,000 people and Popejoy wanted to more than double the seating capacity by bulding a new statdium that would seat 15,000 people.  Popejoy envisioned a stadium that allowed attendees to be as close to the action as possible with no objects restricting their view of the court.  Coach Bob King was responible for the court design and Architect Joe Boehning was responible for the stadium and lot design. Original plans also detailed making the arena with a detachable floor to hold hockey and other sports but the plans were deleted due to high cost.

## Construction
In 1965 the bidding for the project was won by The House Construction Company and construction began swiftly. The stadium design of Boehning underwent transformations while under construction.  The reverse dome design bacame a solution to a budgeting problem faced in completing the project. The Pit floor currently rests 37 feet below ground level but this was not the original plan. During the begginnings of the construction process managers of the project quickly realized that the amount of scaffolding required to buld the stadium above ground would send the project over the 1.5 million dollar budget(roughly 10 million dollars today).  Also creating an arena of this magnitude without supporting columns would not work abouve ground.  These issues led Boehning to adjust his original architecture and design a stadium with only 15 feet of scaffolding above the ground level. Completion time of the project was only one year and The Pit opened its doors to the public in 1966. The Pit would be in its original form of construction until renovations in 1975 and 2009.

## Post Construction
The Pit held its first college basketball game on December 1, 1966 with the mens basketball team defeating Abilene Christian College 62-53. Following completion The Pit grew in season attendance numbers constistently due to larger seating capacity and excitement about Albuquerque first sports stadium that could rival any other in the college basketball genre. The Pit would gain national recognition throughout the years and in 1999 The Pit was awarded #13 on the list of favorite places in the world to view sports.

## The Name
The original name of Dreamstyle Arena in 1966 was University Stadium. University Stadium would later be renamed WisePies Arena in 2014, and the current name Dreamstyle Arena in 2017. No matter what the the name on the signs outside of the building say Albuquerque has always know the Arena as The Pit. Originally The Pit was a nickname for the arena invented by students at the University of New Mexico and the nickname has been the unnofficial title of the arena since 1966.
