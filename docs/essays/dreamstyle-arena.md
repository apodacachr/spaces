# Dreamstyle Arena (AKA The Pit)
## The Concept
Tom L. Popejoy, UNM president 1948-1968, is responsible for many new buildings on the UNM campus and The Pit was one of UNM's most transformative projects that President Popejoy envisioned.  President Popejoy along with Coach Bob King and Architect Joe Boehning created a visual plan and stadium style that would be recognized by architects and sports enthusiasts across the country.  The prior home of Lobo Basketball was the Johnson Gymanasium which held 7,000 people and Popejoy wanted to more than double the seating capacity by bulding a new statdium that would seat 15,000 people.  Popejoy envisioned a stadium that allowed attendees to be as close to the action as possible with no objects restricting their view of the court.  Coach Bob King was responible for the court design and Architect Joe Boehning was responible for the stadium and lot design.

## Construction
In 1965 the bidding for the project was won by The House Construction Company and construction began swiftly. The stadium design of Boehning underwent transformations while under construction.  The reverse dome design bacame a solution to a budgeting problem faced in completing the project. The Pit floor currently rests 37 feet below ground level but this was not the original plan. During the begginnings of the construction process managers of the project quickly realized that the amount of scaffolding required to buld the stadium above ground would send the project over the 1 million dollar budget.  This issue led Boehning to adjust his original architecture and design a stadium with only 15 feet of scaffolding above the ground level. Completion time of the project was only one year and The Pit opened its doors to the public in 1966.

## Post Construction
The Pit held its first college basketball game on December 1, 1966 with the mens basketball team defeating Abilene Christian College 62-53. Following completion The Pit grew in season attendance numbers constistently due to larger seating capacity and excitement about Albuquerque first sports stadium that could rival any other in the college basketball genre.
