# Dreamstyle Arena (AKA The Pit)
## The Concept
Tom L. Popejoy, UNM president 1948-1968, is responsible for many new buildings on the UNM campus and The Pit was one of UNM's most transformative projects that President Popejoy envisioned.  President Popejoy along with Coach Bob King and Architect Joe Boehning created a visual plan and stadium style that would be recognized by architects and sports enthusiasts across the country.  The prior home of Lobo Basketball was the Johnson Gymanasium which held 7,000 people and Popejoy wanted to more than double the seating capacity by bulding a new statdium that would seat 15,000 people.  Popejoy envisioned a stadium that allowed attendees to be as close to the action as possible with no objects restricting their view of the court.  Coach Bob King was responible for the court design and Architect Joe Boehning was responible for the stadium and lot design.
