# Yatoka Hall

Here's a dummy essay that will gradually turn into a real model.

In the meantime, here's a **test image**, hopefully off to the right and taking up 1/3 of the page width.

{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="33%" caption="Yatoka Hall-1973 (Left of man on bike)" src="images/yatoka-hall.jpg" %}
{% include figure.html class="img-left" width="33%" caption="Yatoka Hall-1928" src="images/yatoka-hall-1928.JPG" %}
{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="33%" caption="Yatoka Hall-1950's" src="images/yatoka-hall-1950.JPG" %}
