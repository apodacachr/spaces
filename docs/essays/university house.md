# University House

Here's a dummy essay that will gradually turn into a real model.

In the meantime, here's a **test image**, hopefully off to the right and taking up 1/3 of the page width.

{% include figure.html 
class="img-right" 
width="33%" 
caption="University House" 
src="docs/essays/images/UniversityHouse.jpg" %}
