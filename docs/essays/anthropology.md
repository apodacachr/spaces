# Anthropology Building

Where is the heart of the University of New Mexico? The stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or ever-bustling Student Union Building spring to mind first; many more buildings would appear on that list before any of the science buildings. Located on the western edge of campus, the Anthropology building is a squat complex containing lecture halls, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Like many scWhere is the heart of the University of New Mexico? Some might say the stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or the ever-bustling Student Union Building, but rarely are the hidden-away science buildings considered central to university life. In the day-to-day of campus life, far more time, adoration and vitriol are spent on the Smith Plaza area than anywhere else. But if the university has a historical heart, it lies on the western edge of campus. Shielded by massive pines, the Anthropology building is a squat complex containing a lecture hall, labs, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Though it has a low profile today, it once housed the Student Union Building and bookstore.

## Construction

The 1930s marked one of several bursts of construction for the university thanks to funding from the Works Progress Administration and increased enrollment. During this time, John Gaw Meem’s architectural oversight established UNM’s signature Pueblo Revival style, which the Anthropology Building retains today. One of the four original buildings designed by Meem (the others being Zimmerman Library, Scholes Hall, and Bandelier Hall), the Anthropology Building actually began as the university’s first Student Union. Construction began in 1936; in 1937, an open house followed the dedication of the building, and students broke in their new ballroom with a dance.[C]

The angular silhouette and adobe facade of the building show the off the Pueblo Revival style the university is now known for.

## Renovations
By the 1950s, rising enrollment strained the resources of the diminutive SUB. Construction of a newer, larger Student Union began in 1959, and the ‘old SUB’ was refitted for the purposes of the Anthropology Department. The Anthropology Department moved in to its current home from the Administrative Building (now Scholes Hall) in 1960, and adapted the former SUB ballroom into a lecture hall.[C]

The Anthropology Building has endured many exterior and interior renovations in its lifetime, including the addition of faculty offices, labs, and space for the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, but the most significant changes since the department moved in came in the mid-1970s. Correspondence between university officials reveal frustrations with the Anthropology lecture hall: the ballroom acoustics and spaciousness of the room made it almost unusable for lecturers, and these auditory problems were further exacerbated by an excess of seats versus class sizes (475 seats vs. 200 students); and poor technical equipment and lighting made it difficult to use for film classes, which are normally better suited to large rooms.

## Anthropology, Today
The Anthropology building is easy to overlook; it’s so far west that most students will never pass by it often, so specialized that only freshman in need of / credits and dedicated Anthropology students will actually go inside, and the veritable orchard outside the main entrance even makes it difficult to photograph. For a different generation, the little rectangle on the west of campus was the heart of their college life. The movement of the Student Union Building shifted the entire balance of campus eastward, leaving the dear “old SUB” behind.
