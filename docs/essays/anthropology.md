# Anthropology Building

Where is the heart of the University of New Mexico? The stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or ever-bustling Student Union Building spring to mind first; many more buildings would appear on that list before any of the science buildings. Located on the western edge of campus, the Anthropology building is a squat complex containing lecture halls, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Like many scWhere is the heart of the University of New Mexico? Some might say the stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or the ever-bustling Student Union Building, but rarely are the hidden-away science buildings considered central to university life. In the day-to-day of campus life, far more time, adoration and vitriol are spent on the Smith Plaza area than anywhere else. But if the university has a historical heart, it lies on the western edge of campus. Shielded by massive pines, the Anthropology building is a squat complex containing a lecture hall, labs, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Though it has a low profile today, it once housed the Student Union Building and bookstore.

## Construction

The 1930s marked one of several bursts of construction for the university, and also established UNM’s signature architectural style. An increased student body necessitated the construction of a Student Union, and John Gaw Meem took up the task of designing the building. One of the four original buildings designed by Meem (the others being Zimmerman Library, Scholes Hall, and Bandelier Hall), construction began on the Student Union in 1936. The angular silhouette and adobe facade of the building show the off the Pueblo Revival style the university is now known for. An open house followed the dedication of the building in 1937, and students broke in their new ballroom with a dance.

Rising enrollment in the 1950s strained the resources of the SUB, and in 1959 a new Student Union was constructed—the building we know today. The Anthropology Department moved in to its current home from the Administrative Building (now Scholes Hall) and adapted the former SUB ballroom into a lecture hall.

## Renovations
A number of renovations occurred in the decades after the Anthropology building’s original construction, including the addition of offices and space for the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, but the most significant changes came in the mid-1970s. Correspondence between university officials reveal frustrations with the Anthropology lecture hall: the ballroom acoustics and large classrooms proved almost unusable for lecturers, which were further exacerbated by an excess of seats versus class sizes (475 seats vs. 200 students); and poor technical equipment and lighting made it difficult to use for film classes (see image below). Professors across departments complained about these issues, and an especially evocative letter reveals that instructors would ask to be scheduled in other buildings just to avoid this lecture hall:

## Anthropology, Today
The Anthropology building is easy to overlook; it’s so far west that most students will never pass by it often, so specialized that only freshman in need of / credits and dedicated Anthropology students will actually go inside, and the veritable orchard outside the main entrance even makes it difficult to photograph. For a different generation, the little rectangle on the west of campus was the heart of their college life. The movement of the Student Union Building shifted the entire balance of campus eastward, leaving the dear “old SUB” behind.
