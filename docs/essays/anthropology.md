# Anthropology Building
Where is the heart of the University of New Mexico? The stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or ever-bustling Student Union Building spring to mind first; many more buildings would appear on that list before any of the science buildings. Located on the western edge of campus, the Anthropology building is a squat complex containing lecture halls, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Like many science buildings, it has a low profile on campus, but it once housed the Student Union Building and bookstore.
