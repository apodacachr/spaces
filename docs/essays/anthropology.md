# Anthropology Building
Where is the heart of the University of New Mexico? The stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or ever-bustling Student Union Building spring to mind first; many more buildings would appear on that list before any of the science buildings. Located on the western edge of campus, the Anthropology building is a squat complex containing lecture halls, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Like many scWhere is the heart of the University of New Mexico? Some might say the stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or the ever-bustling Student Union Building, but rarely are the hidden-away science buildings considered central to university life. In the day-to-day of campus life, far more time, adoration and vitriol are spent on the Smith Plaza area than anywhere else. But if the university has a historical heart, it lies on the western edge of campus. Shielded by massive pines, the Anthropology building is a squat complex containing a lecture hall, labs, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Though it has a low profile today, it once housed the Student Union Building and bookstore.

Year constructioThe 1930s marked one of several bursts of construction for the university, and also established UNMâ€™s signature architectural style. An increased student body necessitated the construction of a Student Union, and John Gaw Meem took up the task of designing the building. One of the four original buildings designed by Meem (the others being Zimmerman Library, Scholes Hall, and Bandelier Hall), construction began on the Student Union in 1936. The angular silhouette and adobe facade of the building show the off the Pueblo Revival style the university is now known for. An open house followed the dedication of the building in 1937, and students broke in their new ballroom with a dance.
