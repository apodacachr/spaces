# Anthropology Building

Where is the heart of the University of New Mexico? Some might say the stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or the ever-bustling Student Union Building—not a tucked-away science building on the edge of campus. But if the university has a historical heart, it lies in the Anthropology building. Shielded by massive pines on the western side of campus, this squat complex contains a lecture hall, labs, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Though it has a low profile today, it was once the center of campus life as the original Student Union Building.

## Construction
The 1930s marked one of several bursts of construction for the university thanks to increased enrollment and funds provided by the Works Progress Administration. The needs of the student body called for the construction of a Student Union, and the university tapped John Gaw Meem to design the building. One of the four original buildings designed by Meem (the others being Zimmerman Library, Scholes Hall, and Bandelier Hall), the Anthropology building remains an example of the Pueblo Revival style the university is known for. Construction on the Student Union began in 1936. In 1937, an open house followed the dedication of the building, and students broke in their new ballroom with a dance.[C]

## Renovations

By the 1950s, rising enrollment strained the resources of the diminutive Student Union. Construction of a newer, larger building began in 1959, and the ‘old SUB’ was refitted for the purposes of the Anthropology Department. The Anthropology Department moved in to its current home from the Administrative Building (now Scholes Hall) in 1960. The transition required a number of interior renovations, including the addition of faculty offices, labs, and space for the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. 

Besides these initial changes, the Anthropology Building has endured many exterior and interior renovations in its lifetime, the most significant of which came in the mid-1970s. Correspondence between university officials reveal frustrations with the Anthropology lecture hall: the acoustics and spaciousness of the former SUB ballroom made it almost unusable for lecturers, problems further exacerbated by an excess of seats versus class sizes (475 seats vs. 200 students); and poor technical equipment and lighting made it difficult to use for film classes, which are normally better suited to large rooms.

## Anthropology, Today

The Anthropology building is easy to overlook; it’s so far west that most students will never pass by it often, so specialized that only freshman in need of / credits and dedicated Anthropology students will actually go inside, and the veritable orchard outside the main entrance even makes it difficult to photograph. For a different generation, the little rectangle on the west of campus was the heart of their college life. The movement of the Student Union Building shifted the entire balance of campus eastward, leaving the dear “old SUB” behind.
