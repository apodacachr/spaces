# Marron Hall

Here's a dummy essay that will gradually turn into a real model.

In the meantime, here's a **test image**, hopefully off to the right and taking up 1/3 of the page width.

{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="33%" caption="Marron Hall circa late 90's-early 2000's" src="images/marron-hall.jpg" %}
