 Zimmerman Library is classified as a Late 19th and Early 20th Century Revivals: Mission/Spanish Colonial Revival
 Books, magazines, newspapers, and scholarly journals make up a substantial portion of the collections, but many other formats of information are included. Microforms, maps, DVDs, and posters are vital parts of the research and instructional process at UNM. Many parts of the collections are now available beyond the walls of any library in online digital formats. The acquisition of these materials accelerates with each year, now surpassing print and other tangible formats in terms of the number of titles available. A wide selection of ejournals, ebooks, digital music, and streaming video are available to all UNM students, faculty, and staff. The UL also leads the nation in developing processes to curate, store, and preserve research data created by UNM faculty and students and make it available to the world.

Located in the West Wing in what was once the main lobby, Kenneth Adams' Three Peoples Murals were completed in 1939, shortly after the opening of the library. Adams, the last artist to join the Taos Society of Artists, came to the University as Artist in Residence through a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. His assignment was to teach painting in the Department of Fine Arts and to paint a series of murals in the new library. The rear wall of the main lobby, today's Grand Salon, included a central opening for the service desk flanked by four large niches crowned with corbeled wooden frames. The lower part of the niches was occupied by the card catalog, leaving the upper areas for four murals.

Adams was given specific instructions for the content of the murals. In his proposal for the Carnegie grant, President James F. Zimmerman stated that the murals would represent each of the three major cultures in New Mexico and their contributions to civilization, with the fourth mural depicting the union of the three cultures in the Southwest. In the first panel the Native American cultural contribution is indicated by the arts, featuring basketry, jewelry, pottery and weaving. The Hispanics in the second panel are engaged in agriculture and architecture. Anglo progress though science is the theme of the third panel. The final panel, The Union of the Three Peoples, looks to the future with Native, Anglo, and Hispanic united through a symbolic handshake.

Like many public murals of this period, the works are painted on canvas and mounted on the wall upon completion. This proved to be a fortuitous choice of material: in the 1970s The Union of the Three Peoples panel was twice vandalized. While repairs were costly for the time, they would have been far more so had the murals been painted on the walls, requiring in situ restoration.

In both instances, the vandalism involved paint being applied to the Anglo figure. While the murals were well received during their early history, political changes on campus and in the nation at large changed their reception by some. There has been criticism of what are interpreted as racist overtones of The Union of the Three Peoples panel, which stylistically does place emphasis on the Anglo figure. However, viewing the series in the context of its time, the 1930's, regardless of how we see the work in our own time, we must acknowledge the inclusive vision of James F. Zimmerman and the University. That all three of the cultures prominent in New Mexico are included in this major work of public art at this time in history indicates a respect for the diversity that we so celebrate today.

Reds, Blacks & Golds: Fractured Square Series
Added in 2011, Donna Loraine Contractor's weaving Reds, Blacks & Golds: Fractured Square Series, is the most recent artwork in Zimmerman Library. It was placed in the library by the University's Art in Public Places Program, which is administered by the Department of Cultural Affairs' New Mexico Arts. Located in the public study space on the eastern wall of the first floor, this piece represents the recent trend in campus public art toward smaller works for more intimately-scaled spaces. Students come to this part of the library to read, write, and work on assignments, seeking a place for quiet contemplation; Reds, Blacks & Golds: Fractured Square Series is ideally suited for such a place.

Donna Loraine Contractor has been a resident of Albuquerque since 1988. Her work is found in many venues including the Albuquerque Museum, the International Folk Arts Museum in Santa Fe, and a number of galleries and private collections. She attended St. John's College in Santa Fe with the intent of becoming a mathematician or a scientist. However, by the time she graduated with a bachelor's degree in liberal arts, she had acquired interests in weaving, the history of art, the philosophy of mathematics, and much more. These influences are evident in Reds, Blacks & Golds: Fractured Square Series.

The composition suggests a view through a horizontally-mullioned window on to a brilliant red landscape populated with a frenzy of colorful rectangles that in itself opens on to a view of a night sky containing yet another view of sky and distant horizon. It is almost a visual equivalent to Pirandello's play within a play. Contractor has said that she is interested in Josef Albers' Interaction of Color, which deals with the way our perception of color changes with the association of adjacent colors. This is seen in the way some rectangles seem to "pop out" at us while others of the same color seem to recede.

Many of Donna Loraine Contractor's works are conceived in series reflecting a certain theme. Of her Fractured Square Series, she states that she has two sources of inspiration. One is the work of the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt, who is known for depicting surfaces with flat, geometric patterning in striking color. The other source is what she terms the seemingly fractured nature of life in this modern world, which she then reconstructs into a cohesive and beautiful whole.

The Zimmerman Library is eligible for listing in the National Register at the state level of significance under Criterion C in the area of architecture under the Multiple Property Documentation Form, "Buildings of John Gaw Meem" as an example of the associated property type, public and institutional buildings. The library is among the largest and finest work of New Mexico master architect John Gaw Meem, who designed a state-of-the-art academic library in the Spanish Pueblo-Revival style, with a fireproof stacks tower and reading rooms, which are reminiscent of the interiors of Spanish mission churches. The Zimmerman Library is eligible for listing in the National Register at the state level of significance under Criterion C in the area of art because of the four "tricultural" murals in the Great Hall by Kenneth Miller Adams and the furnishings, fixtures, and hardware, many designed by Meem in the Spanish Colonial Revival style and handmade by local craftsman, harmonize with the design of the library. The Zimmerman Library is eligible for listing in the National Register at the state level of significance under Criterion C in the area of landscape architecture because the Castetter Succulent Garden is among the first succulent gardens in New Mexico and in the Southwest. The Zimmerman Library is eligible for listing in the National Register at the state level of significance under Criterion A in the area of education because the library has served as the principal library for University of New Mexico students and residents of the state. The Zimmerman Library is eligible for listing in the National Register at the state level of significance under Criterion A in the area of politics/government because the library, funded by the New Deal programs, the PWA and WPA, represents one of the highest achievements in New Mexico in architecture, art, decorative arts, and landscape architecture during the Great Depression, when only the federal government had the ability to fund large public works projects across the nation.
Zimmerman Library retains a high level of historic integrity, especially design, materials,
workmanship, setting, feeling, and association. The Meem library remains mostly intact on the
exterior and the interior, which includes hand-made furniture and fixtures designed by Meem and
murals by Kenneth Miller Adams. The property also includes the Castetter Succulent Garden
and the WPA Grove of evergreens, both planted on the west side of the building when the library
was built from 1936 to 1938.
The east façade of the Meem library was mostly removed to make way for an addition in 1966,
but Meem had planned for an addition to be added to the east façade as the library’s holdings
increased. Though twice the size of the Meem design, the additions are inconsequential for
National Register eligibility because they were planned so as not to alter the west, north, and
elevations, historic landscape features, and the original interior design, including the murals and
decorative arts.

There's going to be some more general info about Zimmerman here. YERRRp.

## Construction

John Gaw Meem planned the Zimmerman Library according to standard library practices so that
the building could be expanded as the library’s collections increased. Meem explained that, “the
building is so designed that future additions to both stack space and reading room space can be
easily added when the requirements make such additional space necessary.”1
 Historian David
Kammer states that, “while some of the public and institutional as well as ecclesiastical buildings
that Meem designed have received additions, these additions should not necessarily preclude the
building’s [National Register] eligibility if the original plans anticipated additions and those
additions were sensitively rendered.”2
 In an article published soon after the first library addition
was completed, Meem writes that the addition to the library was “very successful, particularly in
evoking certain basic elements of the style, such as flat roofs, terraced masses, preponderance of
walls over openings, the slightly battered earth-colored walls and softened outlines. . .”3

Architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting was so impressed by the Zimmerman Library
additions that he wrote in Albuquerque Magazine: “Zimmerman Library demonstrates what
excellent results are obtained when architects are humble enough to recognize value in a
predecessor’s work and try to design in harmony with it.”4
George Pearl of the Albuquerque firm Ferguson, Stevens, Mallory and Pearl designed the first
addition to the library in 1966. This addition altered the east side of the library, the least
decorated elevation, so that the stacks tower no longer appears to rise from the ground. This
addition added 97,160 square feet to accommodate 600,000 volumes.
The 1966 addition resulted in few changes to the original interior. The south reading room, now
called the Anderson Room, which had was plainly finished, was remodeled with a large, twostory fireplace and an upper-level mezzanine. A corridor was created along the north side of the
stacks tower to provide access to the new addition. Most significantly, the 1966 addition created
a monumental entrance and portico facing Smith Plaza, which reoriented the main entrance from
the west side to the south side.
A second addition to the library, designed Hal Dean of the Albuquerque firm of Dean, Hunt,
Krueger and Associates, was completed in 1973 and added 65,300 square feet. The addition
extended the library further east. The addition included battered, stucco-covered walls, with
deeply recessed windows and oversized drainage basins
The third major undertaking was mostly confined to interior remodeling by Albuquerque
architect Van H. Gilbert with the Boston firm Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson, and Abbott from
1991 to 1993. These renovations included the installation of a glass wall between the Great Hall
and the Browsing Room, now called the Willard Room. Second-floor renovations included
moving special collections to the stacks and the Anderson Room, which is now part of the Center
for Southwest Research and Special Collections. The Coronado and Thomas Bell rooms were
remodeled to accommodate office space. The skylight in the Great Hall, installed by Meem, but
removed because of leaks, was reinstalled. In 1961, the library was officially renamed from
University Library to Zimmerman Library for University President James Zimmerman, under
whose administration the library was constructed.


## Style

The Spanish-Pueblo Revival-style library included a flat roof and utilizes a reinforced-concrete
frame, load-bearing brick, and structural clay tile. The exterior is finished with battered concrete
covered with stucco. The foundation and footings are poured concrete and brick. The ceilings
are poured concrete that is three feet, five inches thick. The stacks tower includes steel I-beam
reinforcements encased in concrete at the perimeter. The tower floors are reinforced with 18-
inch steel I-beams. The tower, the dominant feature of the building, rises from a flat-roofed twostory center. The main entrance on the west side is flanked by two roughly symmetrical wings,
with three additional wings projecting to the north, east, and south. The large massing of the
stacks tower is relieved by groups of vertical windows containing colored-concrete spandrels
with Art Deco-style Indian designs. The library measures 61,780 square feet.

The cross-axial plan is anchored by the Great Hall, which measures 22 feet wide and 96 feet
long. The beams in this room are constructed of poured concrete encased in carved wood planks.
Four recessed bays above the card catalogs contain a series of four murals by Taos artist Kenneth
Miller Adams. The five projecting reading rooms were designed are supported by hand-carved
vigas and corbels. These reading rooms wings, which are one-and-a-half-stories with open
plans, display the heavy massing and large, multi-paned windows that provide natural light. The
ceilings of the reading rooms incorporate non-structural Spanish-Pueblo Revival-style viga-andlatilla roof construction. In the south reading room, also called the Spanish Room, the ceiling is
plastered.
Many of the interior fixtures and furnishings of the library were also designed by the architect,
including hand-carved tables, chairs, and desks produced by local Hispanic craftsmen. Many of
the Hispanic-style punched-tin lanterns and chandeliers, aspen-pole latilla ceilings, wrought-iron
gates, banisters, and door handles, carved-wood steam-heat register guards were produced by
local craftsman, who were paid by the WPA.

When Spain controlled what is now the southwestern United States, the Spanish officially banned international trade of all kinds. After Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexicans lifted the ban and opened the area to both commercial and cultural exchange. The Santa Fe Trail, which spanned 1,200 miles from Franklin, Missouri to Santa Fe, New Mexico passing through deserts, mountains, and forests along its route, became the main means of transportation to and from the area.

In 1908 the rail company ATSF completed a second tunnel under Raton Pass to handle increased traffic, but developments in rail around the West signaled the decline of Raton Pass as a major rail corridor. First, ATSF finished the Belen Cutoff in central New Mexico, giving the railroad an easier route. Raton Pass continued to be used for passengers, but all long-haul trains now took the Belen Cutoff route. In 1908–9 New Mexico used convict labor to build a new highway that crossed the Colorado border near Raton Pass, further reducing traffic through the area.

Here's a few lines about the history of Zimmerman, right heeeerrreee

##### Location
Zimmerman Library, the main library for the University of New Mexico, is located in the center
of campus in Albuquerque in Bernalillo County, New Mexico. The Spanish-Pueblo Revivalstyle library is one of the largest and finest buildings by New Mexico master architect John Gaw
Meem. Constructed between 1936 and 1938 with PWA and WPA funds, the library is organized
around the Great Hall, with three reading rooms projecting from the north end of the hall and two
on the south end. A nine-story fire-proof stacks tower with vertical bands of windows and
decorative spandrel panels was designed to hold 225,000 volumes. Meem infused the SpanishPueblo Revival design and interior furnishings and fixtures with Native American and Hispanic
designs by local craftsmen. Four murals in the Great Hall depict the Anglo, Hispanic, and
Native American cultures in New Mexico. The nomination includes the Castetter Succulent
Garden and the WPA Grove of evergreens. The east side of the library had been planned for
expansion, and in 1966 the Albuquerque firm Ferguson, Stevens, Mallory and Pearl completed a
three-story addition. In 1973, Dean, Hunt, Krueger and Associates completed a second major
addition on the east side of the 1966 addition. In 1991-1993, the Albuquerque architect Van H.
Gilbert with the Boston firm of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson, and Abbott remodeled the
interior, including spaces in the Meem library.
