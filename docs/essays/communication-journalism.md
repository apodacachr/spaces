#### Overview
The Communication and Journalism Building (C & J) is a two-story, Spanish Pueblo Revival styled building, made of clay tile and stucco, located on the south end of the University of New Mexico (UNM) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Its sits on the corner of Central Avenue and Yale Boulevard with its main entrance facing north towards Redondo Drive.



#### Early History
Before 1947, the study of journalism was not its own department yet, but housed in the English Department. There were two professors teaching literature and writing courses, it included some journalistic, short story writing and book reviewing. By 1920, the department had increased in size and two new lecturers were added to accommodate the English department. After World War II, many returning veterans took advantage of the military's G.I Bill education benefits and universities across the United States saw an increase in enrollment. With the increased student attendance, new English majors were established in 1956, and eventually journalism would later depart and form an independent department. The C & J building originally housed the Printing Plant, post office and UNM Press. It was built by Santa Fe architect, John Gaw Meem-Hugo Zehner and Associates, in 1949 and was built after the chemical engineering building. Meem's work can be seen across UNM campus, to include the Zimmerman Library.
