# Coronado Hall

Here's a dummy essay that will gradually turn into a real model.

	On February 1, 1957 at a meeting of the University regents, authorized President Tom Popejoy to submit plans to propose the building of new men’s dormitory. Final plans for the dormitory were submitted in the fall of 1958 along with the voted name of the building, Coronado Dormintory. In 1959 the dorm was completed for a little more than a $1 million. Robert E. Merrel and Warren F. Pendleton, representing the architectural firm of Shafer from Clovis. The new men’s dormitory was built to alleviate overcrowding in campus dormitories, like Mesa Vista dormitory which had to place students three to a room, moving freshman to fraternity houses and suggestions to upperclassmen to find lodging off campus in town. The dormitory was built east of Mesa Vista on Girard Blvd, and was to house students only, without food service. It was thought that by eliminating a dining hall and kitchen the new dorm would be financed through Federal Home and Housing Agency. Like the other buildings on the campus Coronado was built in the Pueblo Revival style and with its construction a mural commissioned in the lobby of the new building. The mural was titled, “The Spirit of Man” and was painted by the Peruvian artist Guillermo McDonald Juardo who also studied in the Fine Arts college of the University of New Mexico. Like “The Three Peoples Mural” in Zimmerman library the mural depicts the story of the peoples of the New World; the American, the Indian, and the Spaniard. A depiction showing three horses representing the three groups of peoples with the American culture trying to merge the three different cultures into the state of New Mexico.


In the meantime, here's a **test image**, hopefully off to the right and taking up 1/3 of the page width.
